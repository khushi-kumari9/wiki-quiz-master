 # Wiki Quick Quiz (AI Experiment)

This project is a **learning experiment** in AI-assisted full-stack development.  
The purpose was to explore how AI can help generate frontend and backend code for a Wikipedia-based quiz application.

---

## Project Overview

Wiki Quick Quiz allows users to:
- Input a Wikipedia article URL.
- Generate multiple-choice quizzes based on the article content.
- View suggested related topics.
- Track past quizzes (history tab with details modal).

> Note: The frontend (React, TypeScript, Vite) and backend (FastAPI/Django, PostgreSQL) were generated with the help of AI.  
> This project is for **learning and experimentation purposes only**.

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: React + Vite + TypeScript (AI-assisted)
- Backend: FastAPI/Django (AI-assisted)
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Web scraping: BeautifulSoup
- LLM integration: Gemini API via LangChain

## What I Learned
- How AI can scaffold full-stack applications.
- Integration of frontend, backend, and database.
- Use of LLMs to generate quizzes and related topics.
- Basic project deployment and organization on GitHub.
